#+TITLE: Custom Memory Allocator

This is an attempt to replicate the functionality of =malloc(3)= and the suite of related memory-management utilities. I plan to approach the problem in two steps, first prototyping the technique by managing the contents of a large array and subsequently requesting blocks of memory with the =sbrk(2)= system call.

More documentation coming soon...
